---

This document establishes a sovereign Federation of States, built upon
the principles of decentralization, separation of powers and limited
government. This document shall be the supreme law of the Federation.
Any law inconsistent with this document shall be void.

## Article I: Federal Structure

### Section 1

The States of the Federation shall enjoy broad autonomy. Matters related
to issues such as education, social welfare, infrastructure, taxes,
economic affairs and all other matters not addressed by this
Constitution, shall be the exclusive domain of the States.

### Section 2

No State shall prosecute, punish, restrict or otherwise impose a burden
on any individual, business or other entity for legal conduct outside
the State. Nor shall any State ban, restrict or impose an extra tax or
other burden on the buying and selling of imported goods and services,
based on how they were produced outside of the State. A State may
however require the labeling of imported goods and services with the
means of production in a neutral manner. This clause shall not be
construed to mean that evidence from outside the State may not be used
in court cases, nor that factors outside the State may not be considered
when assessing the value of properties inside the State for tax
purposes.
No State shall put in place tariffs or other trade barriers on exports or
imports to protect their local industry from outside competition, neither
from other States nor from foreign nations, except what may be absolutely
necessary for executing the State's inspection laws. Any exceeding revenue
shall be destroyed.
No State shall discriminate against citizens of other States in favor of its
own citizens in regards to basic privileges and immunities. Such privileges
and immunities include protection by the government; the enjoyment of life
and liberty; the right of a citizen of one State to pass through, or to reside
in any other State, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits,
or otherwise; to claim the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus; to initiate
and maintain legal actions in State courts; to own, hold, and dispose of property;
and to be exempt from higher taxes or impositions than those paid by other
State citizens.
No State shall have a jurisdiction larger than 150000km^2^
No State shall enter into any military treaty or alliance, grant privateering
licenses, coin money or issue currency, emit bills of credit, or pass any
law that impairs the obligation of contracts entered outside the State.
No State shall, without the consent of the Expenditure Congress, lay any duty
of tonnage, keep troops, or military equipment in time of peace, or engage
in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit
of delay.

### Section 3

Each State shall recognize the public acts, records, and judicial
proceedings of every other State. However, this does not mean that a
State must enforce another State's judgment or statute if it contradicts
its own public policy.
A person charged with a crime in any State who flees from justice and is found
in another State shall, upon request from the executive authority of the State
from which they fled, be returned to the State with jurisdiction over the
crime.

### Section 4

Physical property shall only be taxable by the State where it is
located. Property which is difficult to assign to a physical location,
such as digital currency, shall only be taxable by the State where the
owner is resident. Cross-border transactions, such as remote work or
online purchases, shall only be taxable by one State according to rules
set by the Expenditure Congress, but there shall not be any special tax
on cross-border transactions that would institute a tariff, and the
rules shall be based on the nature of the transaction, and shall not
take into consideration the tax rates or financial situation of the
different States.

### Section 5

Every State in the Federation shall be on an equal footing; and no
federal law shall discriminate against any State unless it is predicated
on a real and substantial difference relevant to the power under which
the law is enacted.

### Section 6

The federal government shall guarantee to every State in the Federation
a republican form of government, with appropriate checks and balances,
and separation of powers, and shall protect each of them against
invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive
(when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.
Every State shall have an independent judiciary, and a separation
between the power to spend and the power to raise revenue. The federal
courts shall have jurisdiction to decide whether a State has denied its
people a republican form of government.

### Section 7

New States may by law be admitted into the Federation by the Expenditure
Congress, but no new State shall be formed within the jurisdiction of an
existing State, nor any State be formed by the merger of two or more
existing States, without the consent of the legislatures of the States
concerned as well as of the Expenditure Congress. The only exception to
this is that the Expenditure Congress may, by law, form a new State from
the territory of an existing State upon petition from citizens of that
State, the recognition of such petitions to be regulated by the
Expenditure Congress.
The Expenditure Congress shall have the the authority to manage and regulate
the territories and properties owned by the federal government. Additionally,
nothing in this Constitution should be interpreted in a way that harms the
claims of the Federation or any individual State.

### Section 8

Upon the identically-worded resolutions of the legislatures of
two-thirds of the States, or of States with two-thirds of the national
population, any federal law or regulation, identified with specificity,
is thereby rescinded; once rescinded, such a law may be reenacted
according to the procedures specified in Article II.

### Section 9

This Constitution, along with the laws of the Federation enacted in
accordance with it, and all treaties made under the authority of the
Federation, shall be the supreme law of the land. Judges in every State
shall be bound by it, regardless of any conflicting provisions in State
constitutions or laws. Federal Senators and Representatives, members of
State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers at both the
federal and State levels shall be bound by oath or affirmation to
support this Constitution. However, no religious test shall ever be
required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the
Federation.

## Article II: Legislative Branch

### Section 1

All federal legislative powers shall be divided between two distinct
legislative bodies. One shall be known as the Revenue Congress, and the
other as the Expenditure Congress. Each Congress shall consist of two
separate chambers: a Senate and a House.

### Section 2

The House shall consist of 550 Representatives. Of these, 500
Representatives shall be elected through a nationwide popular vote, and
ensure proportional representation of the electorate. Specifically, they
shall be elected via a closed party-list system, where each political
party receives a number of seats proportional to their share of the
vote. There shall be no minimum threshold of votes required for a
political party to obtain their share of the seats, other than the
minimum threshold dictated by the number of available seats.
Additionally, 50 Representatives shall be selected through sortition in
a lottery where all eligible citizens can enter their names.
Representatives shall serve four-year terms, with elections and selections
occurring every four years. The election and selection of Representatives
in the Revenue Congress shall be staggered by two years compared to those
in the Expenditure Congress. Each Representative shall have one vote in the
House. The terms of Representatives shall begin at noon on the third Monday
of June following the election and shall end at the same time four years later.
In the event of vacancies in elected seats, the political party that originally
filled the seat shall be entitled appoint a new Representative to serve the
remainder of the term. Vacancies in selected seats shall remain unfilled until
the full four-year term has elapsed.

### Section 3

The Senate shall consist of two Senators from each State. Senators shall
be appointed by their respective State governments in accordance with
their State constitution. In the event of vacancies, the State may
appoint a new Senator to serve the remainder of the term. Each Senator
shall have one vote in the Senate.
The terms of Senators shall begin immediately upon appointment and shall conclude
concurrently with the terms of the Representatives in the Revenue Congress
who were serving at the time of the appointment.

Each State legislature shall prescribe the exact times, places and other
details of polling stations in their respective State for the election
of Representatives, but the Electoral branch may at any time make or
alter such regulations.
No person shall be a federal legislator
who is not at least 25 years of age.
No person shall be a federal
legislator who has already served three terms as a federal legislator.

in both the Revenue Congress and Expenditure Congress at the same time, nor
shall any person hold multiple seats in a single Congress.
No
person shall serve as a federal legislator whilst also serving as a
legislator, governor, judge or other government official in a State
government.

### Section 5

Each Senate and each House shall have a board of proposed legislation
where members can at any time add their own proposed bills, as well as
their signature to proposed bills to signal their affirmative vote. For
a bill to become law it shall have passed both chambers of the
appropriate Congress. For a bill to pass a chamber it shall have gotten
affirmative votes of more than 60% of the whole chamber, including
vacant seats. The only exception are bills which solely repeal one or
more previously passed bills in their entirety, they shall only need 50%
affirmative votes to pass, and shall only need to pass in one chamber of
the appropriate Congress to come into effect. Repeal-bills themselves
and bills admitting new States into the Federation cannot be repealed
through this mechanism. All changes to the constitution must go through
the constitutional amendment proceure outlined in article 8. All bills
shall cite where in the constitution the scope of the legislation is
authorized.
Affirmative votes for bills in the Revenue
Congress that raise taxes, borrow on credit, or otherwise tries to raise
revenue shall implicitly also count as an affirmative vote for bills
that tries raise revenue by the same mechanism but by a lower amount.
Each Senate and each House shall keep a journal of its
proceedings, and from time to time publish said journal, excepting parts
that may in their judgment require secrecy. All votes shall be entered
on the journal.
Each Senate and each House may otherwise determine
the rules of its proceedings as long as they are compatible with constitutional
requirements.

### Section 6

Senators and Representatives shall in all cases, except felony and
breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance
of their respective chambers, and in going to and returning from the
same; and for any speech or debate in either chamber, they shall not be
questioned in any other place.

shall, during the time for which they were elected, be appointed to any
civil office which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof

subdivision thereof, any obligation or duty to make expenditures unless
