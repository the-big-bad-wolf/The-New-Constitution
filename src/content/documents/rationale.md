No country seems to revere its constitution quite like the United States.
Yet after a century of sustained government expansion, with little sign of
reversal, it is hard to deny that the U.S. constitutional order has
important structural weaknesses. Some failures come from interpretation,
but if a constitution is repeatedly interpreted in ways that undermine its
purpose, that is itself a design problem.

At the same time, the U.S. model has produced durable successes that are
worth preserving and strengthening. This rationale identifies those
strengths, diagnoses key failures, and proposes institutional reforms aimed
at protecting limited government, federalism, and economic freedom.

## What has worked

### Separation of powers

Separation of powers can reduce interventionism because officials are less
likely to expand state power when political opponents may later control
that power. In comparative terms, the U.S. has often had stronger
executive-legislative separation than parliamentary systems. A distinct
judiciary has also been a major success globally.

However, the U.S. presidency has accumulated excessive influence. In
particular, the veto power gives the executive a quasi-legislative role
that blurs the separation principle. A new constitution should deepen
institutional separation and reduce opportunities for power concentration.

### Enumerated rights protections

Explicit rights protections (for example, speech protections) have often
constrained government abuse. But rights language can erode over time
through reinterpretation or mismatch with changing technology and social
conditions. If constitutional limits are unrealistically rigid, political
actors may bypass or dilute them rather than obey them.

The implication is not that rights protections should be weaker, but that
constitutional design should focus on institutions that systematically
reward restraint. As Milton Friedman argued, the goal is not to rely on
electing perfect people, but to make it politically profitable for
imperfect people to do the right thing.

### Federalism and interjurisdictional competition

Federalism can discipline policy by allowing people and capital to move
between states. Competition between jurisdictions tends to pressure
governments toward lower regulatory and tax burdens than they would
otherwise impose. This mechanism depends on free movement of people and
goods, plus real limits on central authority.

A persistent weakness in the U.S. experience is federal overreach through
constitutional interpretation, including expansive readings of federal
power. A revised constitution should include stronger safeguards that
preserve meaningful state autonomy.

### Bicameralism and divided government

Bicameral legislatures can slow legislation and reduce policy volatility.
Conflict between chambers can function as a brake on rapid expansion of
spending and regulation. The upper chamber can also represent subnational
interests and counterbalance majoritarian centralization.

A new constitution should preserve bicameralism, reinforce the upper
chamber’s state-representative function, and design electoral timing to
increase constructive inter-branch and inter-chamber tension.

## What has not worked

The American electoral process creates persistent representation and
incentive problems. Winner-take-all systems marginalize minority
viewpoints and channel politics into broad, polarized party coalitions. At
the same time, dispersed costs and concentrated benefits create strong
incentives for rent-seeking, where organized interests secure targeted
gains while costs are spread across the public.

This dynamic can also weaken the virtues of gridlock: compromise may
become mutual accommodation of special interests rather than reciprocal
restraint. A new constitution should therefore redesign representation and
budgeting institutions to reduce rent-seeking incentives.

## Core proposals

Based on the analysis above, the following reforms are proposed:

1. **Separate revenue power from spending power.**
  Create dedicated “revenue chambers” with sole authority over taxation
  and borrowing, while existing legislative chambers retain authority over
  spending and ordinary lawmaking. This separates the political incentives
  to raise money from the incentives to spend it.

2. **Remove the presidential veto.**
  The veto undermines strict separation of powers and over-concentrates
  authority in the executive.

3. **Adopt proportional representation for the lower house.**
  Replace winner-take-all elections with proportional representation (for
  example, party-list systems) to improve minority representation.

4. **Strengthen state influence in federal institutions.**
  Have state governments appoint senators and Supreme Court justices, and
  expand the Court to reflect the number of states.

5. **Replace the Electoral College with a national ranked method.**
  Elect the president by nationwide popular vote using a ranked method
  such as ranked pairs.

6. **Stagger elections to increase institutional conflict.**
 Use election timing that reduces one-party capture across all institutions at once.

7. **Cap state geographic size (or require subdivision above a threshold).**
 Smaller states increase policy competition and reduce local monopoly power.

8. **Constitutionally guarantee interstate mobility and commerce.**
 Protect free movement of people, goods, and services across states.

9. **Limit federal competence to non-aggression enforcement and foreign policy.**
   Define powers with precision, remove vague clauses, and include concrete
   examples to minimize interpretive drift.

10. **Require a lower threshold to repeal laws than to enact laws.**
    Example: simple majority to repeal, supermajority to pass. This
    offsets the structural tendency toward legal accumulation.

## Additional ideas for exploration

The following concepts merit further development and empirical review:

- **Sortition elements in governance**, including potential use in
  minister selection or partial chamber composition.
- **Minority or sector representation mechanisms**, as used in some jurisdictions.
- **Constitutional monetary constraints**, including legal-tender design
  choices that limit discretionary fiscal extraction.
- **Tax-base redesign**, including making federal taxation dependent on
  state-level revenue bases.
- **Different electoral systems across chambers** to maximize institutional independence.
- **Short federal term limits** to reduce national-level personalistic leadership.
- **Secession safeguards tied to constitutional amendment events**.
- **Balanced-budget constraints with emergency supermajority escape clauses**.
- **Ban policing for profit, executive in-house courts, prison labor, and
  abusive procedural tactics**.
- **Single-subject bill rules, anti-rider provisions, and constitutional
  citation requirements in legislation**.
- **Pre-enactment constitutional review models and narrower judicial jurisdiction**.
- **Independent constitutional plaintiff/guardian offices** with standing
  to challenge ultra vires acts.
- **Limits on conditional grants and retroactive taxation**.
- **Expanded standing for state and federal officials to sue for
  constitutional violations**.
- **State override mechanisms in defined enforcement domains**.

## Design principle

The central design objective is not to assume benevolent leaders, but to
create institutions where political survival aligns with limited
government. Durable constitutional success depends less on ideal
officeholders and more on incentive-compatible structures that make
centralization difficult, visible, and reversible.

## Open question

Which additional institutional mechanisms best protect limited government
and free-market capitalism without creating constitutional rigidity that
later actors can easily circumvent?
